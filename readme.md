# Front End Web Application

##  Introduction
The web application that is being created will be an Accountacy firm informational website. The website will be mainly to advertise and inform potential customers of what the company does. The website uses informs users of what the business does, what it offers, how to contact the business and background information on the business.

##  Motivational
The idea for developing a website for an accountacy firm was from my brother who has recently become self employed and had asked me to create a website for him. The website is aimed towards sole traders and small limited companies as the accountacy firm is very small so it will deal with small businesses.

The business has been running for over 6 months now, the business has a few clients but requires a website to increase the client base and so the business can seem more professional by having a website on the business cards of the business.

## Designs
Designs were made for three different views: Mobile, Tablet and Desktop. The designs are what the end user should be able to see on the website.

##Features
1. Single Page Application(SPA) - The site is an SPA which allows the user to browse through the web application without changing page and having to wait for the page to load whilst changing page.

2. The Navigation Bar - This is positioned at the top of the page and it has three different types. The desktop version of the navigation is horizontal and has tabs on top of the page. The tablet version has them in a vertical line showing all the navigation options. The emobile version has the navigation options hidden and only gets shown once the menu is pressed.

3. Smooth Scroll - The website uses smooth scroll  and it is inside the html tag on the css.

4. Hover Over Images - The images have a text that shows up and opacity changes which show up when the mouse is hovered over the images.

5. Google Map - The Google Map is an API that was found from Google themselves, a personal key is required to use Google Map.

6. Contact Form - The contact form has labels, text boxes and radio buttons. When the button is pressed it shows a pop up message stating the form has been submitted.

7. Sitemap - The sitemap is another navigation tool and there is a "Back to the top" button which goes to the top.

##P.A.R.C Principles of Visual Design

1. Proximity - Related items should be grouped together, this keeps the items organised.
2. Alignment - Every visual element on the page should have a connection to at least one other element, this makes the content flow well.
3. Repetition - Common elements such as colours, graphics and layout styles should be similar, this keeps the website and layout consistant.
4. Contrast - Separating elements which are not similar, this separates different elements.

##Conclusion
In conclusion I believe majority of what has been covered in Front End Web Development has become very clear to me. The fundamentals have allowed me to learn and enhance my web development knowledge and skills. Overall during this module I have learnt about the three languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I have learnt how they can be combined to create well functioning websites.
