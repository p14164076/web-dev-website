# Front End Web Application

##  Introduction 
The web application that is being created will be an Accountacy firm informational website. The website will be mainly to advertise and inform potential customers of what the company does. The website uses informs users of what the business does, what it offers, how to contact the business and background information on the business.

##  Motivational
The idea for developing a website for an accountacy firm was from my brother who has recently become self employed and had asked me to create a website for him. The website is aimed towards sole traders and small limited companies as the accountacy firm is very small so it will deal with small businesses.

The business has been running for over 6 months now, the business has a few clients but requires a website to increase the client base and so the business can seem more professional by having a website on the business cards of the business.
