# **Front End Web Application**

## ** Introduction **
The web application that is being created will be an Accountacy firm informational website. The website will be mainly to advertise and inform potential customers of what the company does. The website uses informs users of what the business does, what it offers, how to contact the business and background information on the business.

## ** Motivational **
The idea for developing a website for an accountacy firm was from my brother who has recently become self employed and had asked me to create a website for him. The website is aimed towards sole traders and small limited companies as the accountacy firm is very small so it will deal with small businesses.
